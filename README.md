## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I think I've got much better at making things responsive! There's a lot more that I can learn, but for the first time I've been able to make the page seamlessly streck and shrink without any issues.

### Continued development

This time I got into cross browser compatibility problems and I understood that I'll have to learn more about that.

### Useful resources

- [min(), max() and clamp() are CSS magic!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VF-4euyRo) - This tutorial by Kevin Powell introduced me to the magic of clamp(). Using this property I could make font-sizes responsive with only one line of code! That's really cool, thanks Kevin.
